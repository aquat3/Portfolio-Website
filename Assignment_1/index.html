            <p>

                I am a senior at the University of Maryland College Park graduating this December. I have experience in
                Object-Oriented Programming, Database Design, and Front-end Web Development. I have a solid foundation
                in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and jQuery. I am proficient in Front End development and I plan on
                learning Back End tools in the future. I am enrolled in a FullStack Web Development course this Fall
                using PHP and MySQL and I will have some knowledge by the time I graduate. I am currently seeking
                full-time positions for the Winter in order to further strengthen my skills in Web Development. I have a
                strong passion to learn new technologies and solve complex problems.
